Update history
Most likely as a result of her dominating performances in the competitive scene of Ultimate, Peach has been nerfed overall by patch updates. In patch 1.1.0, her dash attack's knockback scaling has been reduced, hindering its effectiveness as a fast KO option. As of patch 3.0.0, her Toad can no longer be used to stall indefinitely in the air, now only stalling at its first use, and her Vegetables deal less shield damage, hindering the projectiles' shield pressure capabilities.
Patch 3.1.0 has arguably nerfed her harder than in any other patch update as of now: Both back throw and forward aerial deal less knockback, further weakening what was considered to be her more effective KOing options, Peach Bomber has more endlag when connected, hindering its safety against shields, and Vegetable has more endlag, leaving Peach more vulnerable to enemy attacks when plucking turnips. Moreover, the removal of held item attacks makes her options when holding a turnip less versatile.
Peach has received a few buffs, however. Thanks to its changes in 2.0.0, 3.1.0, and 5.0.0, Peach Parasol connects more reliably against opponents, patch 3.1.0 allows jab to connect more efficiently, and forward smash's golf club swing deals more knockback, improving its KO potential.
